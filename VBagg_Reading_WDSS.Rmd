## Aggregated Outputs: Bag Observation Model

.panelset.sideways[
.panel[.panel-name[Data]

We have the following data

1. A **bag** of inputs $x^a = \lbrace x_1^a, x_2^a, \dots, x_{N_a}^a\rbrace$ coming from $N_a$ individuals

1. A total of $n$ such bags

1. For each bag we have its **aggregated output** $y^a$

Hence, our dataset is:

$$(\lbrace x_i^1 \rbrace_{i=1}^{N_1}, y^1)\;(\lbrace x_i^2 \rbrace_{i=1}^{N_2}, y^2)\;\cdots\;(\lbrace x_i^1 \rbrace_{i=1}^{N_n}, y^n)\;$$

]

.panel[.panel-name[Model]
The aggregated output is related to the bag via de following **Bag Observation Model**

$$y^a|x^a \sim p(y|\eta^a)$$ 
$$\eta^a := \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} w_i^a\;\eta(x_i^a)$$

where the $w_i$ represent (possible) fixed weights. The inference goal is on the individual *mean parameters* $\eta(x_i^a)$.  

]

.panel[.panel-name[Poisson Example]

- Suppose we have aggregated counts, 

- But we know the population sizes at the individual level $p_i^a$ (as well as other covariates $x$). Then, the bag population can be $p^a=\sum p_i^a$.

-We are interested in the individual rates $\lambda_i^a$ of the following Poisson model:

$$y^a|x^a \sim \text{Poisson}(p^a\lambda^a)$$ 
$$\lambda^a := \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \dfrac{p_i^a}{p^a}\;\lambda(x_i^a)$$

]

.panel[.panel-name[But...]

#### Is it that simple?

- Non linear form of $\eta(x_i^a)$

- Usually *a lot* of individuals per bag 

#### What to do?

## Variational Bag Aggregated Model with Gaussian Processes

.panel[.panel-name[Poisson Example]

- Suppose we have aggregated counts, 

- But we know the population sizes at the individual level $p_i^a$ (as well as other covariates $x$). Then, the bag population can be $p^a=\sum p_i^a$.

-We are interested in the individual rates $\lambda_i^a$ of the following Poisson model:

$$y^a|x^a \sim \text{Poisson}(p^a\lambda^a)$$ 
$$\lambda^a := \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \dfrac{p_i^a}{p^a}\;\lambda(x_i^a)$$

]

.panel[.panel-name[GP]

Model the complicated and unobserved relationship as a **Gaussian Process**

$$\lambda(x_i^a) = \Psi(f(x_i^a)) \qquad f\sim GP(\mu,k)$$

where $\Psi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^+$ is a suitable transformation like $\Psi(f) = \exp(f)$ or   $\Psi(f) = f^2$.

]

.panel[.panel-name[Inducing Points]

Since GP are complicated and we have many individuals, they propose also to consider some **inducing points** $\lbrace u_l\rbrace_{l=1}^m$, which are the evaluations of the process at *landmark points* $\lbrace z_l\rbrace_{l=1}^m$, so that

$$u_l := f(z_l),$$

so that

$$u \sim N_m(\mu_Z, K_{Z,Z})$$

]

.panel[.panel-name[Likelihood]

We are then interested in the following (log) likelihood:

$$\log p(Y) = \log \int\int p(Y, f, u) dfdu = \log \int\int \prod_{a=1}^n p(y^a|\eta^a)p(f | u) p(u)  df du$$

which is quite complicated, so they propose using **Variational Inference** to approximate it.
